###——Description:
This dataset is a collection of boundary annotations of a cappella singing performed by Beijing Opera (Jingju, 京剧, wiki page) professional and amateur singers. This dataset was used as the experimental dataset in the following work:

Rong Gong, Nicolas Obin, Georgi Dzhambazov and Xavier Serra, “Score-Informed Segmentation of Jingju Singing Phrases into Syllabic Units by Syllable Onset Detection" in FMA 2017


The boundaries have been annotated in a hierarchical way. Line (phrase), syllable, phoneme singing units have been annotated to a jingju (Beijing opera) a-cappella singing audio dataset.

The corresponding audio files are the a-cappella singing arias recordings, which are stereo or mono, sampled at 44.1 kHz, and stored as wav files. The wav files are recorded by two institutes: those file names ending with ‘qm’ are recorded by C4DM Queen Mary University of London; others file names ending with ‘upf’ or ‘lon’ are recorded by MTG-UPF. If you use this audio dataset in your work, please cite as well the following publication:
